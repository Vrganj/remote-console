# remote-console
A simple CLI remote console using Pterodactyl's API.
Yes, I know the code is a clusterfuck.

## Configuration

To run, you must have a config.yml.

Here's an example configuration for HeavyNode:
```yaml
api-url: https://control.heavynode.com
api-key: nShheXVvjtez2rUug2mo19nJWnvRtOa61gPi0vUe39u1zuup
server-id: e8df598f-16b9-3ebc-b27b-fc3a84653a8b
```
You can get the API key and server id from the panel.
